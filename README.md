# Expo CLI: Mysterious Build/Configuration Error

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the Expo CLI produces an uncommon, vague error message related to inconsistencies in the project's `package.json` or EAS build configuration. The error does not directly pinpoint the problem, requiring a systematic approach to identify and resolve underlying configuration issues. 

## Problem Description

The Expo CLI might throw an unexpected error during build, start, or deployment.  The error message lacks specificity, making debugging difficult. This can involve problems with dependencies, native modules, or settings.  

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Attempt to run `expo start` or perform a build using `eas build`.  The exact error encountered may vary but generally manifests as an unexpected failure without a clear indication of the root cause. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining the `package.json` and EAS configuration files to ensure consistency and correctness. This includes:
* Verifying dependency versions and resolving potential conflicts.
* Checking for missing or incorrect settings in the EAS build configuration (e.g., correct platform specifications, required plugins).
* Ensuring that all necessary native modules are correctly installed and linked.
* Cleaning the project's cache (`expo prebuild --clean`).
