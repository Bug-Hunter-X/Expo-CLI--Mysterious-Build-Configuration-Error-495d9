The solution usually involves a careful review of your `package.json` file and EAS build configuration.  Common fixes include:

1. **Check `package.json` for inconsistencies:**
   - Ensure all dependencies and devDependencies are correctly specified and compatible.
   - Resolve any version conflicts using tools like `npm-check-updates`.
   - Verify that the versions listed match the actual installed versions (run `npm ls` or `yarn why` to check).

2. **Examine EAS build configuration:**
   - Review the `eas.json` file meticulously.
   - Verify that the platform you're building for is correctly specified.
   - Ensure that any required plugins are correctly configured and listed.
   - Double-check the build options and settings for correctness.

3. **Clean and rebuild:**
   - Before making changes, try cleaning the project's cache using `expo prebuild --clean`.
   - After making adjustments to `package.json` or `eas.json`, reinstall dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`) and then try building again.

4. **Native module issues:** If you're using native modules, carefully review their integration.  Make sure they're correctly linked and their dependencies are aligned.

5. **Check Expo SDK version:** Ensure compatibility with the version of Expo SDK used in your project.

If the problem persists, provide the precise error message and relevant parts of your `package.json` and `eas.json` for further analysis.
