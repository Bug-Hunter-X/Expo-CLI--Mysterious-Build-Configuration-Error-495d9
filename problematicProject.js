This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with projects that have inconsistencies in their package.json or EAS configuration files.  It can manifest in various ways, such as unexpected build failures, issues with starting the development server, or problems with deploying to various platforms.  Often, the underlying cause is a mismatch between dependencies, missing or incorrect configuration settings, or conflicts between Expo modules and native libraries.  The cryptic error message doesn't point directly to the root cause, requiring investigation into the project's setup.
